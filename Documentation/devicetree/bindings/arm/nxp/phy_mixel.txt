Mixel DSI DPHY for MX8

The MIPI-DSI DPHY IP block found on MX8 platforms comes along the MIPI-DSI
IP from Northwest Logic and represents the physical layer for the electrical
signals for DSI.

Required properties:
- compatible: 		"mixel,mipi-phy"
- reg:			The register range of the PHY controller
- id:			If there are multiple PHY blocks,
			define the instance number

Example:
	mipi0_phy: mipi0_phy@56228300 {
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <0>;
                compatible = "mixel,mipi-phy";
                reg = <0x0 0x56228300 0x0 0x100>;
                power-domains = <&pd_mipi0>;
                use_sc;
                id = <0>;
                status = "disabled";
                #phy-cells = <0>;
        };
